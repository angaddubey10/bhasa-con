Looking at your API specification, I can see you have a comprehensive social media platform with authentication, user management, and posts functionality. Let me analyze the APIs and create a structured plan to implement the Flutter UI with API integration. Now let me create a comprehensive plan for implementing the Bhasa Con Flutter app with API integration. Based on your OpenAPI specification, here's the detailed task breakdown:

## **BHASA CON FLUTTER APP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & AUTHENTICATION**
