# Header Navigation Implementation Workflow

## Analysis

Current state:
- No persistent header/navigation component exists
- Each page (HomePage, FeedPage, LoginPage, RegisterPage) handles navigation independently
- Missing global navigation, search, notifications, and user menu functionality
- Router structure exists but lacks layout with persistent header
- Authentication context is available for user state management

## Plan

### Goal
Implement a Facebook-like persistent header navigation system with:
- Logo/brand, search bar, main navigation icons, user menu
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Integration with existing authentication and routing
- Search functionality for users and posts
- Notifications system foundation
