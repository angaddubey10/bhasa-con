# UI Testing with Playwright - Login Flow

## Plan

### Goals
- Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Create comprehensive UI tests for login flow
- Test both successful and failed login scenarios
- Ensure tests run in CI/CD pipeline

### Tasks
- [x] Install Playwright and dependencies
- [x] Configure Playwright settings
- [x] Create test utilities and fixtures
- [x] Write login flow tests
  - [x] Successful login test
  - [x] Invalid credentials test
  - [x] Empty form validation test
  - [x] Network error handling test
- [x] Add test data management
- [x] Configure test environment
- [x] Document test execution

## Implementation Notes

### Test Structure
- Tests will be located in `tests/ui/` directory
- Using existing `testapi.py` file as base, will rename to `test_login_ui.py`
- Will create Playwright configuration file
- Test data will use fixtures for user credentials

### Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Login**: Valid credentials → redirect to feed page
2. **Invalid Credentials**: Wrong email/password → error message shown
3. **Form Validation**: Empty fields → form validation errors
4. **Network Errors**: API down → proper error handling
5. **Loading States**: Show spinner during login process

### Tech Stack
- Playwright Python library
- pytest for test framework
- Test fixtures for user data
- Page Object Model for maintainability

## Review

### Completed
- ✅ Analysis of login page structure
- ✅ Understanding of auth context flow
- ✅ Workflow documentation setup
- ✅ Virtual environment created (.venvtest)
- ✅ Playwright and dependencies installed
- ✅ Browser binaries downloaded (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- ✅ Pytest configuration created
- ✅ Page Object Model implemented (LoginPage, FeedPage)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created with 11 test scenarios
- ✅ Test utilities and helpers implemented
- ✅ Test runner script created

### Test Files Created
1. `tests/ui/testapi.py` - Main test file with comprehensive login flow tests
2. `tests/ui/pages/login_page.py` - Page Object Model for login page
3. `tests/ui/pages/feed_page.py` - Page Object Model for feed page
4. `tests/ui/utils.py` - Test utilities and data management
5. `tests/conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures and configuration
6. `pyproject.toml` - Pytest configuration
7. `run_ui_tests.py` - Test runner script

### Test Scenarios Implemented
1. **Page Load Test** - Verify login page loads correctly
2. **Form Validation** - Empty fields validation
3. **Email Validation** - Invalid email format handling
4. **Successful Login** - Valid credentials flow
5. **Failed Login** - Invalid credentials handling
6. **Loading State** - UI feedback during requests
7. **Remember Me** - Checkbox functionality
8. **Navigation** - Register page link
9. **Error Clearing** - Error messages clear on input change
10. **Network Errors** - Graceful handling of network failures
11. **Accessibility Tests** - Keyboard navigation and labels

### Next Steps
- Test execution requires running backend and frontend servers
- Manual verification of test scenarios
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Addition of more user flows (registration, logout, etc.)

## Decisions
- Using Python Playwright for consistency with backend
- pytest as test runner for integration with existing test suite
- Page Object Model pattern for better test maintainability
