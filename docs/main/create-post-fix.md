# Create Post Button Fix - Workflow

## Problem Analysis

From the Docker logs, I identified that the main issue is not with the create post button itself, but with the JWT authentication system. The error shows:

```
jose.exceptions.JWSError: Expecting a string- or bytes-formatted key.
```

This error occurs during login when trying to create access tokens, which means users can't authenticate properly, and therefore can't create posts.

## Root Cause

The JWT SECRET_KEY environment variable appears to be improperly formatted or not passed correctly to the JWT library. Even though the docker-compose.yml contains a SECRET_KEY, the library expects a string or bytes format.

## Plan

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Identify JWT authentication error in backend logs
- [ ] Fix SECRET_KEY format issue in security.py
- [ ] Test user login functionality
- [ ] Verify create post API endpoint works after authentication fix
- [ ] Test create post button functionality in frontend
- [ ] Verify post creation end-to-end flow

### Implementation Steps

1. **Fix JWT Secret Key Issue**
   - Ensure SECRET_KEY is properly formatted as string/bytes
   - Add proper error handling for JWT operations
   - Test authentication flow

2. **Verify Backend API**
   - Test POST /api/posts endpoint with proper authentication
   - Check if post creation works via API directly
   - Verify database insertion

3. **Test Frontend Integration**
   - Check if frontend properly sends authentication headers
   - Verify create post form submission
   - Test error handling in UI

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete user flow: login â†’ create post â†’ view post
   - Verify all components work together

## Current Status
- **Issue identified**: JWT authentication was fixed - backend is running successfully
- **Current issue**: Create post button has no functionality - needs onClick handler and modal/form
- **Progress**: 
  - âœ… Created CreatePostForm component with full functionality
  - âœ… Added modal state management to FeedPage.jsx
  - âœ… Connected form to backend API (/api/posts endpoint)
  - âœ… Added image upload functionality
  - âœ… Rebuilt frontend container with new components
- **Next step**: Test the complete create post flow

## Identified Root Cause
The create post button in `FeedPage.jsx` was just a static button without any click handler or functionality. The backend API endpoints exist and are working, but the frontend didn't connect to them.

## Implementation Plan
1. âœ… Create CreatePostForm component in `frontend/src/components/posts/CreatePostForm.jsx`
2. âœ… Add modal state management to FeedPage.jsx
3. âœ… Connect form submission to backend API
4. ðŸ”„ Test the complete flow

## Features Implemented
- Modal-based post creation form
- Content validation (1-500 characters)
- Language selection (English/Hindi)
- Image upload functionality
- Real-time character counter
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
