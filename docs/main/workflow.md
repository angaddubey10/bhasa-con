- `init-db.sql` - Database initialization
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `DOCKER.md` - Complete Docker setup documentation

**Key Features:**
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Health checks for all services
- Volume persistence for data
- Development vs production configurations
- Environment variable management
- Security hardening (non-root users, proper networking)
- API proxy configuration in Nginx
- Hot reload for development
- [ ] Set up Railway deployment configuration
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up database migrations for production
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Final testing and deployment

## Implementation Notes

### Technology Decisions
- **Backend**: FastAPI for async performance and automatic API docs
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite for fast development and building
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context for auth
- **Deployment**: Railway for both frontend and backend with managed PostgreSQL

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. Separate backend and frontend repositories within the same project
2. JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
3. Image uploads handled via Cloudinary for CDN benefits
4. Pagination for all list endpoints to handle scale
5. UUID primary keys for security and distributed systems compatibility

## Tasks

### Current Sprint: Core Features - Posts
- [x] Implement post creation API endpoints
- [x] Build post creation UI with image upload
- [x] Create post feed with pagination
- [x] Implement like functionality
- [x] Add post display with proper formatting
- [x] Test post creation and display flows
- [x] Fix feed page to actually fetch and display posts from API
- [x] Create PostCard component for individual post display
- [x] Add posts service for API communication
- [x] Implement proper loading states and error handling
- [x] Add like/unlike functionality to posts
- [x] Add post deletion functionality
- [ ] Test all post functionality thoroughly

## Review

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] All code follows Python PEP 8 and JavaScript/React best practices
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging implemented
- [ ] Input validation on both client and server side
- [ ] Security best practices followed (password hashing, JWT, CORS)
- [ ] Database queries optimized with proper indexes
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Unit tests written for critical functionality
- [ ] API documentation generated and accurate

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Database queries optimized and indexed appropriately
- [ ] Image uploads handled efficiently with Cloudinary
- [ ] Frontend bundle size optimized
- [ ] API responses paginated appropriately
- [ ] Caching strategies implemented where beneficial

## Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Database Schema**: Using UUIDs for primary keys for better security and scalability
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration and automatic refresh
3. **File Uploads**: Cloudinary for image storage and transformation
4. **API Design**: RESTful design with consistent response format
5. **Frontend State**: React Query for server state, Context for authentication
6. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
7. **Deployment**: Railway for both services with managed PostgreSQL database

### Pending Decisions
- Caching strategy (Redis vs in-memory)
- Background task processing approach
- Real-time features implementation (if needed)
- Analytics and monitoring tools

## Current Status: Feed Functionality Implemented
**Last Updated**: August 29, 2025

### Recent Fixes Applied
✅ **Fixed Feed Display Issue**: The feed page was showing placeholder content instead of actual posts

**Root Cause**: The FeedPage component was not actually fetching posts from the API - it only showed static placeholder content.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Created Posts Service** (`frontend/src/services/posts.js`):
   - Complete API service for all post-related operations
   - Methods: getFeed, getUserPosts, createPost, deletePost, likePost, unlikePost
   - Proper error handling and parameter validation

2. **Built PostCard Component** (`frontend/src/components/posts/PostCard.jsx`):
   - Individual post display with author info, content, images
   - Interactive like/unlike functionality with optimistic updates
   - Delete functionality for post owners
   - Proper date formatting using date-fns
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

3. **Updated FeedPage Component** (`frontend/src/pages/FeedPage.jsx`):
   - Real API integration to fetch posts from backend
   - Pagination with "Load More" functionality
   - Filter toggle between "All Posts" and "Following"
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Empty state messaging
   - Proper state management for posts, likes, and deletions

4. **Fixed AuthContext Export**:
   - Fixed missing export of AuthContext from contexts/AuthContext.jsx
   - Required for FeedPage to access current user information

**Dependencies Added**:
- `date-fns`: For proper date formatting in posts

**Key Features Now Working**:
- ✅ Posts are fetched and displayed from the actual API
- ✅ Real-time like/unlike functionality 
- ✅ Post deletion for post owners
- ✅ Pagination with load more posts
- ✅ Filter between all posts and following posts
- ✅ Proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive post cards with images
- ✅ Author information display

### Next Steps: Social Features
- [ ] Implement follow/unfollow functionality
- [ ] Build user search and discovery
- [ ] Create user profiles with follower/following counts
- [ ] Test social features integration with feed filtering
