# Deploy Branch Workflow

## Current Issue: CORS Errors in Production

### Analysis
- Frontend is getting CORS errors when trying to access backend API
- Error shows: "Access to fetch at backend URL from origin frontend URL has been blocked by CORS policy"
- No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource

### Plan
- [x] Check current CORS configuration in FastAPI backend
- [x] Verify production environment variables and origins
- [x] Update CORS settings for Railway deployment URLs
- [ ] Test the fix

### Implementation Notes
Working on CORS configuration for production deployment.

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated `backend/app/main.py` to read CORS_ORIGINS from environment variables instead of hardcoding
2. Added OPTIONS method to allowed CORS methods for preflight requests
3. Added debug logging to help troubleshoot CORS issues
4. Environment variable CORS_ORIGINS is already set correctly in nixpacks.toml

**Root Cause:** 
Backend was hardcoding CORS origins instead of reading from environment variables, preventing dynamic configuration in different environments.

### Tasks
- [x] Review current CORS setup in backend/app/main.py
- [x] Check if Railway production URLs are included in allowed origins
- [x] Update CORS configuration if needed
- [x] Push changes to trigger redeployment
- [ ] Validate fix works in production
