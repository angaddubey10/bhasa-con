# Deploy Branch Workflow

## Recent Fix: Mixed Content Issues - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The frontend was making HTTP requests to the backend instead of HTTPS, causing mixed content security errors. The browser was blocking HTTP requests from the HTTPS frontend application. The issue was traced to hardcoded URLs in the frontend utility function rather than properly using environment variables.

### Implementation
- **Fixed API URL configuration**: Updated `frontend/src/utils/index.ts` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` environment variable
- **Created proper .env file**: Added `.env` file with correct HTTPS backend URL
- **Rebuilt frontend**: Regenerated dist files with proper environment variable usage
- **Verified build output**: Confirmed built JavaScript uses HTTPS URLs only

### Tasks
- [x] Identify source of mixed content errors  
- [x] Fix hardcoded HTTP URLs in frontend utility functions
- [x] Add environment variable usage
- [x] Create .env file with correct configuration
- [x] Rebuild and verify frontend build
- [x] Deploy updated frontend

## Recent Improvement: Main.py Refactoring - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The main.py file was overly complex with excessive debug logging, hardcoded configurations, and scattered OpenAPI setup. Based on reference code from a production system, several improvements were needed.

### Plan
- [x] Create proper configuration management system (config.py)
- [x] Simplify logging setup and remove excessive debug output
- [x] Improve CORS configuration using settings
- [x] Add proper global exception handling
- [x] Clean up startup/shutdown lifecycle management
- [x] Simplify FastAPI app initialization
- [x] Remove complex custom OpenAPI configuration (can be re-added later if needed)
- [x] Use settings-based configuration throughout

### Implementation Notes
**Major improvements made to main.py:**

1. **Configuration Management**: Created `app/config.py` with a Settings class that:
   - Manages environment variables centrally
   - Provides clean CORS origins configuration
   - Handles application metadata and settings
   - Uses proper environment-based configuration

2. **Simplified Logging**: 
   - Removed excessive debug logging that was cluttering production
   - Clean, professional logging setup
   - Configurable log level via settings

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added global exception handler for unhandled exceptions
   - Maintained HTTP exception handler with consistent format
   - Proper error logging and user-friendly responses

4. **Clean App Structure**:
   - Simplified FastAPI app creation
   - Removed complex custom OpenAPI configuration (can be re-added when needed)
   - Clean router inclusion without excessive debug logging
   - Professional startup/shutdown management

5. **Settings-Based Configuration**:
   - CORS origins from environment variables
   - Server host/port configuration
   - Debug mode based on environment
   - App metadata from settings

### Tasks
- [x] Create configuration management system
- [x] Refactor main.py to use settings
- [x] Simplify logging and remove debug clutter  
- [x] Add proper exception handling
- [x] Clean up app initialization
- [x] Test the improved structure

### Review
The main.py file is now much cleaner and follows production best practices:
- Professional structure similar to reference implementation
- Centralized configuration management
- Proper error handling and logging

## Current Issue: 307 Redirect on POST /api/posts - IN PROGRESS

### Analysis
The frontend is getting a 307 Temporary Redirect when making POST requests to `/api/posts`. The issue is:
- Backend route is defined at `/` in the posts router (which becomes `/api/posts/` with the prefix)  
- Frontend is calling `/api/posts` (without trailing slash)
- FastAPI automatically redirects POST `/api/posts` → `/api/posts/` causing a 307 redirect

### Plan
- [x] Identify the source of 307 redirects in POST requests
- [x] Fix backend routing to handle trailing slash issue properly  
- [ ] Test that POST requests work without redirects
- [ ] Update documentation

### Implementation
**Fixed the 307 redirect issue by adding duplicate route handlers:**
- Added `@router.get("")` and `@router.post("")` decorators alongside existing `@router.get("/")` and `@router.post("/")` 
- This allows the backend to handle both `/api/posts` and `/api/posts/` URLs directly
- Eliminates the need for FastAPI to redirect, preventing the 307 Temporary Redirect response
- Committed and pushed changes to trigger Railway auto-deployment
- Settings-based approach for environment management
- Eliminated excessive debug logging that was cluttering production

This improvement should help resolve the router loading issues in production by removing the complex debugging code that might have been causing conflicts.

### Decisions
- Removed complex custom OpenAPI configuration for now (can be re-added later if needed)
- Used environment-based configuration for better deployment flexibility
- Maintained all existing functionality while cleaning up the code structure

## Previous Issue: Missing Authentication in Swagger Documentation

### Analysis
- Protected endpoints are not showing proper authentication requirements in Swagger UI
- HTTPBearer security scheme is defined in dependencies but not registered with FastAPI OpenAPI
- Users can't test protected endpoints through Swagger docs interface
- Missing "Authorize" button in Swagger UI

## Previous Issue: CORS Errors in Production - RESOLVED

### Analysis
- Frontend is getting CORS errors when trying to access backend API
- Error shows: "Access to fetch at backend URL from origin frontend URL has been blocked by CORS policy"
- No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource

### Plan
- [x] Add HTTPBearer security scheme to FastAPI OpenAPI configuration
- [x] Update main.py to include security definitions
- [x] Test Swagger documentation shows "Authorize" button
- [x] Verify protected endpoints show lock icons
- [ ] Standardize security scheme names (HTTPBearer vs bearerAuth)
- [ ] Test authentication through Swagger interface

### Implementation Notes
Working on Swagger authentication documentation.

**CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Production router loading failure (unrelated to authentication)**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Even with NO custom OpenAPI configuration, production only shows 4/20+ endpoints
- This indicates a fundamental router loading failure in production environment
- Issue exists in the base deployment, not related to authentication changes

**Current Production Issues:**
1. Only 4 endpoints loading: `/`, `/health`, `/api/posts` (partial), `/api/auth/profile` (partial)
2. Missing all other authentication endpoints: register, login, me, logout
3. Missing all user endpoints: profile CRUD, follow/unfollow, search, avatar upload
4. Missing most post endpoints: CRUD, like/unlike, image upload

**Likely Causes:**
- Import dependency failure in production environment
- Missing packages or environment variables preventing router initialization
- Silent exception during router loading that doesn't crash the app

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Add debug logging to router loading
- [ ] Deploy with debug logging and check production logs
- [ ] Check production logs for import errors
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are available in production environment

**Debug Logging Added:**
1. ✅ Import process logging in main.py
2. ✅ Router loading process with try/catch
3. ✅ Individual router module loading logs
4. ✅ Route registration counts for each router
5. ✅ Complete route list after startup
6. ✅ Debug endpoint at `/debug/routes` for runtime inspection

**Current Status:**
Ready to deploy and analyze production logs to identify the router loading failure.

**Changes Made:**
1. Fixed `backend/app/main.py` to properly read CORS_ORIGINS from environment variables instead of hardcoding `["*"]`
2. Added better debug logging to help troubleshoot CORS issues
3. Fixed `frontend/src/utils/index.ts` to use VITE_API_URL environment variable instead of hardcoded URL
4. Updated `backend/nixpacks.toml` to include multiple CORS origins including localhost for development
5. Environment variable CORS_ORIGINS now includes both production and development URLs

**Root Cause Found:** 
1. Backend was hardcoding CORS origins as `["*"]` instead of reading from environment variables
2. Frontend was hardcoding the backend API URL instead of using environment variables
3. Missing localhost origins in CORS configuration for development testing

### Tasks
- [x] Review current CORS setup in backend/app/main.py
- [x] Check if Railway production URLs are included in allowed origins
- [x] Update CORS configuration if needed
- [x] Push changes to trigger redeployment
- [ ] Validate fix works in production

### Review
TBD

## Current Issue: Mixed Content Error on Post Creation

### Analysis
- Frontend (HTTPS) is trying to make HTTP requests to localhost backend
- Error: "Mixed Content: The page at 'https://bhasa-con-production.up.railway.app/feed' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://bc-backend-production-7180.up.railway.app/api/posts/'"
- Frontend utils/index.ts is hardcoded to localhost:8000 instead of production backend URL

### Plan
- [x] Fix frontend utils/index.ts to use production backend URL
- [x] Ensure backend URL is HTTPS (not HTTP)
- [ ] Test post creation functionality
- [ ] Verify API endpoints work correctly

### Implementation Notes
The frontend was incorrectly configured to use localhost instead of production backend URL.

**Fixed:**
```typescript
// Before (causing Mixed Content error):
const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8000'

// After (fixed):
const baseUrl = 'https://bc-backend-production-7180.up.railway.app'
```

**Root Cause:** The commented line was the production URL, but the active line was localhost, causing HTTPS frontend to make HTTP requests to localhost instead of the production HTTPS backend.

### Tasks
- [x] Update frontend/src/utils/index.ts to use production backend URL
- [ ] Deploy and test post creation
- [ ] Verify all API calls work with HTTPS backend

### Review
TBD
