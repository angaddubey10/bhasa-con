# Deploy Branch Workflow

## Current Issue: CORS Errors in Production

### Analysis
- Frontend is getting CORS errors when trying to access backend API
- Error shows: "Access to fetch at backend URL from origin frontend URL has been blocked by CORS policy"
- No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource

### Plan
- [ ] Check current CORS configuration in FastAPI backend
- [ ] Verify production environment variables and origins
- [ ] Update CORS settings for Railway deployment URLs
- [ ] Test the fix

### Implementation Notes
Working on CORS configuration for production deployment.

### Tasks
- [ ] Review current CORS setup in backend/app/main.py
- [ ] Check if Railway production URLs are included in allowed origins
- [ ] Update CORS configuration if needed
- [ ] Validate fix works in production
